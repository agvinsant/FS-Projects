        	<strong>What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.? Japan? Great Britain?</strong>
            <br/><br/>U.S. : Games (17.62%), Entertainment (9.99%), Education (9.67%). (2012, ). • Statista - The Statistics Portal for Market Data, Market Research and Market Studies. • Apple: most popular app store categories in July 2012 | Statistic.

                    <br/><br/>Japan: Top categories include productivity and utility apps as well as games. (2012, ). Xyo - Search For Mobile Apps And Games. Xyologic - App Stats. Retrieved December 9, 2012, from http://xyo.net/app-downloads-reports/Japan/09.11.2012/
                    
                    <br/><br/>UK : Top categories are much like the US, entertainment, games, and social apps. Productivity and education are also big categories. (2012, ).

        	<strong>Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?
			</strong>
            <br/><br/>This tells me that the US and UK markets are quite similar and mainly focused on social and entertainment type apps, things to really just kill time in your day. Whereas the Japanese are mainly using utility and production apps. Really fits the national profile. Letting you know that the Japanese people as a whole are extremely concerned with production.

        <p>
        	<strong>What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?
			</strong>
            <br/><br/>US: 4.8mbps average at $3.33 per mb per month USD.
                    <br/>Japan: 61mbps at $.27 per mb per month USD.
                    <br/>UK: 3.8 mbps at $3.31 per mb per month USD.

                    This effects development because it makes developers have to be aware of the size of the apps that they can create and have to pay attention to the amount of data that is transmitted. Japanese markets can produce bigger games, more involved and colorful websites etc, because of the amount of bandwidth and the price. I would stay online all the time, streaming videos, music, etc.

        <p>
        	<strong>And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</strong>
            <br/><br/>My suggestion would be to create an app that incorporates these top categories. I would suggest something that incorporates Facebook, Twitter, etc, into an app that also might use these platforms for social gaming. 
                    <br/><br/>Another would possibly to create a productivity app that incorporates contacts from your favorite social platform. This could be something that would also create email, notes, to-do lists, etc, and to share them with your friends or family on the social platform.

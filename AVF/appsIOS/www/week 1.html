                Less obvious perks of using 'live' data resources include logins and payments. How could Twitter be used in these two scenarios?</strong><br/><br/>
                In my app, people will be able to log into Twitter and be able to use that account to access music by different artists and be able to use that account information to buy different songs. They would also be able to tweet about those songs or try to set up an automatic tweet saying that they just bought a song.

                Visit Programmableweb.com and search for JSON-P data sources. Why would we need JSON-P, specifically?
                </strong>
                <br/><br/>
                JSON-P is used as a way that developers load data directly from the client side servers without having to go through the original server. It helps eliminate errors when browsers try to pull data that otherwise wouldn't be allowed. In my app, I will use data from Beatport and Last.FM to pull songs by different artists to playback. I am hoping to get it set up to where you will be able to find artists in your geographical location, but we will see.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Based on the JSON-P search results: what data resource(s) do you think might pair well with which types of Native device features?
            </strong>
            <br/><br/>
                I think I would be able to pair up the geolocation features as well as using playback features for finding musicians in a particular area. I could possibly use map features to find night clubs and concert halls in that particular area.
            </p>

                Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.
            </strong>
            <br/><br/>
                In addition to what I have explained above, I would like to be able to use the capture features to record from the built in mic to be able to use for podcasting, voiceovers, or to be able to record your sound and share it with your Twitter friends. It's a way to get song ideas out. I would like to get the camera funtions working so you can take pictures of your favorite artist and share it directly on the Twitter feed along with songs and such from the data resources. Basically a social music site, kind of like Soundcloud, but not.

                Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.
            </strong>
            <br/><br/>
                Time management is a big thing for me. Trying to juggle 2 jobs, family, and school is hard. Just being organized and being able to properly organize what I need to get done by when is probably the most important lessons that I have learned, and still trying to work on.

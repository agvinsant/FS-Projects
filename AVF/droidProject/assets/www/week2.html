        	<strong>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance)</strong>
            <br/><br/>I have always been a fan of simple designs. I guess one way to help accessibility for the hearing visually impaired would be to add a noise of some sort when the buttons are pushed to indicate they have pushed the button a click sound for instance. Maybe the title of the button they pushed. If they are accessing the camera, then when they click the button, let it say camera. But I am not sure if that is really whay is being asked. Possibly adding sub titles to the videos. As far as the structure of the HTML itself, there is not much that I think I would need to change. It is really a pretty simple structure as is.

        	<strong>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</strong>
            <br/><br/>On the couple of videos I watched, the common frustration would be things being repeated multiple times. Maybe if the page structure was set better, then this wouldn't happen. Also, I saw on one example that if the page uses tables for text content, the screen reader will read it wrong and the user will not know what is being read because it will be out of sync. The best way to fix this would be to lay sites out in a simple structure style.

        	<strong>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</strong>
            <br/><br/>Well one being really any I device such as the iPad, iPod, or iPhone. Being that my new job is working for Apple and living in SWFL where we are in the retirement capital of the world, I have been able to see many accessibiliy options for these devices. One option is SIRI and voice control. By pairing with bluetooth headsets, this is also a great option for the hearing impaired.
 			Another device is the XBOX 360's Kinect. It makes game play for handicapped people easy by using movements instead of just having to rely on the controllers.
        </p>
        <p>
        	<strong>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</strong>
            <br/><br/>Ariadne GPS is a map/navigation app for IOS that helps the blind navigate their way around. 
			Capturefish is a IOS app that helps the hearing impaired to be able to watch videos and use other voice services by using captions.

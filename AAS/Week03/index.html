                <p style="padding:10px">I am a tropical kind of guy. So if I had the chance to work outside of the United States, it would probably be in the Bahamas.
                With the beautiful sights and landscape, why wouldn't it be a great place to do business? </p>
                <p style="padding:10px">Business opportunities in the Bahamas are virtually endless, just like their beautiful white beaches.
                So if you are looking for a new business opportunity in a new place, why don't you consider The Islands of The Bahamas.</p>
                <p style="padding:10px">There are over 700 islands that make up the Islands of Bahamas that is spread out over one hundred thousand square miles of ocean starting just fifty miles off the coast of Florida.
                The archipelago is an ecological oasis featuring about two thousand beautiful islands and cays and has some of the clearest water on the planet, with a visibility of over two hundred feet.
                About the Bahamas.(n.d.). <span style="font-style:italic">http://www.bahamas.com/bahamas/about-bahamas-0</span> (11/9/2012).</p>
                <p style="padding:10px">With being such a beautiful place to live, work, and play, it is natural that people from all over the world flock to the Islands of Bahamas for vacations.
                These tourists come from all over, the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and beyond. Being a British run colony, it is not shocking that the Bahamas are a big vacation destination for many Brits and Europeans. Nassau is the most visited island due 
                to it's beautiful landscape and the many resorts that have popped up on the island over the years.</p>
                <p style="padding:10px">With  all the influx of different cultures that come to this island nation, The Bahamians have learned to adapt to Western cultures. They are exposed to it on a daily basis as they many work for resorts, as tour boat guides, island guides, make and sell souvenirs, etc.
                Many Bahamians are multi-lingual and are adapted to many different cultures. So, because of this, within the main Bahamian culture, there are many Westernized sub-cultures. Although they are swarmed with all this outside influence, the Bahamians do a great job in preserving their own laid-back, island living style.</p>
                <p style="padding:10px">As you can imagine, with all the tourism that occurs all year, the Bahamas would be a great place to start a business. Not only do you have the tourists that would be customers, you also have the locals. With the housing market booming in this island nation, real estate, construction, and renovations are huge businesses. 
                As more and more people from around the world come to the Bahamas to build or buy vacation homes, the sky is the limit.</p>

            	<center><img src="images/about_about_people.jpg" style="padding:10px"/><p>Bahamian Straw Weaver. (n.d.) Our People. <span style="font-style:italic">http://www.bahamas.com/bahamas/people</span> (11/9/2012).</p></center>
                <h3>The People</h3>
                <p style="padding:10px">When your home resembles paradise, it's pretty easy to see why so many Bahamians have a laid-back attitude.
                In general, it's an attitude of let's worry about the bad things tomorrow. Most Bahamians embrace life with a warm smile. They are humble
                people who love to celebrate life. Give them a reason to throw a festival, and they will. Both weddings and funerals are important social events to Bahamians.
                It is an opportunity to celebrate the new life starting and the life that has been lived. They take great pride in the stories of their past. (n.d.). Our People. <span style="font-style:italic">http://www.bahamas.com/bahamas/people</span> (11/9/2012).</p>
                <p style="padding:10px">The culture is a melting pot of many native customs ranging from indigenous "Indian" people who have poulatied the Bahamas over the years, including
                West African, English, and other cultures who have arrived in the Bahamas over the last three to four hundred years. (.n.d.). Bahamian Culture. <span style="font-style:italic">http://www.bahamasgateway.com/culture.htm</span> (11/9/2012). Bahamians are definitely not universalists, they believe in the concepts of cultural reletiveism by accepting the many different cultures that they are exposed to and integrate them into their society. </p>
                <h3>Bahamian Cuisine</h3>
                <p style="padding:10px">Though you can find virtually and type or style of food from around the world, you would be seriously missing out by not sampling the local cuisine. It doesn't matter where you are, you won't have any difficulty finding plenty of establishments serving local Bahamian dishes and fresh local seafood at reasonable prices.
                The cuisine of The Islands OF The Bahamas is never bland. The locals like their food spicy, subtly and uniquely flavored. With local meats and produce, more than any other food in the West Indies, the cooking has been influenced by the American South.  (n.d.) Bahamian Cuisine. <span style="font-style:italic">http://www.bahamasgateway.com/cuisine.htm</span> (11/9/2012).</p>
                <h3>Art, Music, and Dance</h3>
                <p style="padding:10px">At the heart of every Bahamian is self-expression. Whether through colorful art, lively music, or soulful dancing, it is a part of everyone in the Bahamian culture. It reflects the beauty of the islands and the pride they have for each other and their country. Music plays a big part in the culture. As you travel through the islands, you will hear traces of African rhythms, Caribbean Calypso, English folk songs, or 
                the traditional Goombay music, which is a mix of African and European colonial influences. (n.d.). Our Local Customs. <span style="font-style:italic">http://www.bahamas.com/bahamas/local-customs</span></p>
                <p style="padding:10px">Through art, music, and dance is also a way the Bahamians blow off daily stresses. No matter if you live in paradise or not, there is still stress. Through their laid back, island style culture, Bahamians often use these art forms not only for expression, but to unwind as well. That is another reason they like to have many festivals and celebrations. They do this to keep the concept of an easy life, and not to let things bother them as much as many other Western cultures.</p>
            	<h3>Religion</h3>
                <p style="padding:10px">Most of the Bahamian nation practices the Christian faith, with Baptists comprising about thirty-two percent. About twenty percent of the population are Anglicans and about twenty-four percent are of other denominations such as Methodists and Church of God. In any community you will find many different churches and denominations. Christianity is also considered an academic subject in government schools. Very small groups, or sub cultures, include Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and Rastafarians. (2012). The Bahamas- Religions. <span style="font-style:italic">http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Americas/The-Bahamas-RELIGIONS.html#b</span> (11/9/2012).</p>
            	<h3>Language</h3>
                <p style="padding:10px">The language of the Bahamians is primarily English. Although, you might hear Bahamian English. It's a mix of UK dictation, African influence, and island dialect. The "h" is often dropped, so it sounds like "ouse" for "house" or "t'anks" for "thanks." The dialect and idioms were influenced by African slaves, English Puritans and other settlers. With this combination you will hear a language that is completely unique to the Islands Of The Bahamas. (n.d.). Our Language. <span style="font-style:italic">http://www.bahamas.com/bahamas/language</span> (11/9/2012).</p>
                <p style="padding:10px">The language itself is a huge example of cultural relativeism, in the way they have shaped their language around many other cultural influences. </p>

                <h3>Business and Finance</h3>
                <p style="padding:10px">The Bahamas has a stable "free-market" oriented government, and an outstanding income tax policy. That policy is, "no income taxes". This means that the Bahamas is the perfect place to do business. Because of this, the Bahamian real estate market is booming, as thousands of Americans, Europeans, and Asians are discovering that this sub-tropical, island heaven is the best place to buy their second home. (2000). Business and Finance in the Bahamas. <span style="font-style:italic">http://www.thebahamasguide.com/business/default.htm</span> (11/9/2012). Business practices mirror a combination of the outside cultural influence and their local cultures. Much of their economy is based on tourism and off-shore banking. To me it's the perfect place for work and play.</p>
                <h3>Government</h3>
                <p style="padding:10px">To use the formal name, The Commonwealth Of The Bahamas, is one of the most politically stable countries in the world. Their constitution is based on the Westminster Model: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, The Executive Branch, The Legislative Branch, and Judicial Branch.
                Bahamians are member of the Commonwealth of Nations, all are former British colonies, and recognize Queen Elizabeth II as their Head of State. The Queen's representative is the Governor-General.
                The Cabinet is made up of at least nine Ministers that are headed by the Prime Minister and Attorney General.
                Parliament makes up the Legistative Branch, which is made up of a Senate and house of Assembly. Parliament is responsible for making laws for peace, order, and good government practices. (n.d.).
